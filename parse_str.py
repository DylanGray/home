test3 = "Crest factor: Crest factor is a parameter of a waveform, such as alternating current or sound, showing the ratio of peak values to the effective value. In other words, crest factor indicates how extreme the peaks are in a waveform. Crest factor 1 indicates no peaks, such as direct current or a square wave. Higher crest factors indicate peaks, for example sound waves tend to have high crest factors.Crest factor is the peak amplitude of the waveform divided by the RMS value of the waveform. This is equivalent to the ratio of the Lâˆž norm to the L2 norm of the function of the waveform... From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia."

### There is currently a bug in end lind duplication for certain combinations of input string and max string length
### uncomment below for example

#A1 = parse_str(test1, 24)
#AE1 = parse_str(test1, 25)   
#AE2 = parse_str(test1, 26)
#A2 = parse_str(test1, 27)
#print_dict(A1)
#print_dict(AE1)
